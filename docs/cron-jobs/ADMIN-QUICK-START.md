**How to use**:

## Key Concepts

### Job Queue vs Cron Jobs

**Job Queue** = Individual tasks (run once)
**Cron Jobs** = Recurring schedules (create job queue tasks automatically)

Think of it like:
- Cron = "Every Monday at 9 AM, add 'Send report' to my todo list"
- Job Queue = The actual todo list that gets worked on

### Two Types of Syncs

**Incremental Sync** (`game_platform_sync`)
- Fetches recent challenge solves
- Fast (uses `after_time_unix`)
- Sets flags for totals refresh

**Totals Sweep** (`game_platform_totals_sweep`)
- Refreshes aggregate stats
- Slower (full recalculation)
- Only processes flagged competitors

**Best practice**: Run incremental first, then totals 10 minutes later

## Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet

| Problem | Quick Fix |
|---------|-----------|
| Jobs stuck in Pending | Check if Job Processing is ON |
| No recent cron runs | Check if crons are Active in Cron Jobs page |
| Jobs failing repeatedly | Click on job to see error, then retry |
| Data not updating | Click Full Sync button |
| Too many API calls | Switch to Off-Season schedule template |
| Need to stop everything | Toggle Job Processing OFF |
