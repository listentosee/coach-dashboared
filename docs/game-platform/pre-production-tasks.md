### 7. Load Testing üî•
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Owner:** Engineering

- [ ] **Test sync job performance**
  - Time a full sync with mock data (all 18 competitors)
  - Estimate time for production (100+ competitors)
  - Verify database can handle volume

- [ ] **Simulate failure scenarios**
  - Network timeout during sync
  - Partial sync completion (some succeed, some fail)

  - API rate limit hit

- [ ] **Optimize if needed**
  - Add database indexes if queries are slow
  - Consider batch processing if single-threaded is too slow
  - Implement request throttling if hitting rate limits

## Blockers & Dependencies

### External Dependencies
1. **MetaCTF API Token** - Waiting on vendor
   - Risk: Could delay launch by days/weeks
   - Mitigation: Start request immediately, escalate if delayed

2. **Pilot Coach Availability** - Need coach commitment
   - Risk: Pilots may be too busy
   - Mitigation: Offer incentive (early access, feedback credit)

### Internal Dependencies
1. **Database Migration** - Must be applied before deploy
   - Risk: Migration could fail in production
   - Mitigation: Test in staging first, have rollback plan

2. **Monitoring Infrastructure** - Need logs/alerts working
   - Risk: Issues go unnoticed
   - Mitigation: Manual monitoring first 48 hours if needed
