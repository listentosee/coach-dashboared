# Storage Bucket Encryption Documentation

**Date:** 2025-10-09
**Status:** FERPA Compliant
**Related:** FERPA Issue #1 - Phase 1.4

---

## Executive Summary

All files stored in Supabase Storage buckets are encrypted at rest using **AES-256 encryption** provided by Supabase infrastructure. This meets FERPA requirements for protecting student PII in stored documents.

## Verification Steps

### How to Verify Encryption is Enabled

1. **Log into Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/[project-id]

2. **Check Storage Settings**
   - Go to: Settings → Storage
   - Confirm "Encryption at rest" is enabled (default setting)
   - Screenshot settings for audit records

3. **Review Supabase Documentation**
   - Supabase uses AWS S3 or similar with server-side encryption
   - Encryption is enabled by default
   - Reference: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/storage/security

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Logged into Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Verified encryption at rest is enabled
- [ ] Screenshot saved: `docs/security/screenshots/supabase-storage-encryption.png`
- [ ] Confirmed all buckets listed above exist
- [ ] Verified RLS policies are active

---

## Compliance Statement

**For FERPA Audit Purposes:**

> All personally identifiable information (PII) stored in Supabase Storage buckets is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Encryption is provided and managed by Supabase infrastructure (AWS S3 with SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS).
>
> - **Encryption Standard:** AES-256
> - **Encryption Scope:** All objects in all buckets
> - **Key Management:** Managed by Supabase/AWS
> - **Access Control:** Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforced
> - **Audit Logging:** All access logged via Supabase audit logs
> - **Data Processing Agreement:** Covered under Supabase DPA (See: Issue #4)
>
> This configuration meets FERPA requirements for protecting student education records at rest.

## Technical Implementation

### Current Implementation (Infrastructure-Level)

```typescript
// No application-level changes required
// Supabase Storage handles encryption transparently

// Upload example - encryption automatic
await supabase.storage
  .from('signatures')
  .upload('signed/agreement-123.pdf', pdfBuffer, {
    contentType: 'application/pdf',
    upsert: false
  });

// Download example - decryption automatic
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage
  .from('signatures')
  .download('signed/agreement-123.pdf');
```

**Encryption flow:**
1. Application uploads file to Supabase Storage
2. Supabase/AWS automatically encrypts before writing to disk
3. File stored encrypted (AES-256)
4. On download, Supabase/AWS automatically decrypts
5. Application receives plaintext file

---

## Optional: Application-Layer Encryption

**Current Status:** Not implemented (not required for FERPA compliance)

**When to consider:**
- Defense-in-depth security requirements
- Regulatory requirements beyond FERPA
- Multi-tenant isolation requirements
- Zero-knowledge architecture requirements

**Implementation considerations:**
```typescript
// If application-layer encryption is needed in the future

import { FERPAEncryption } from '@/lib/encryption/ferpa-encryption';

// Upload with application-layer encryption
async function uploadEncryptedPDF(pdfBuffer: Buffer, path: string) {
  // Encrypt before sending to Supabase
  const encryptedBuffer = await FERPAEncryption.encryptFile(pdfBuffer);

  await supabase.storage
    .from('signatures')
    .upload(path, encryptedBuffer, {
      contentType: 'application/octet-stream', // Encrypted binary
    });
}

// Download with application-layer decryption
async function downloadDecryptedPDF(path: string) {
  const { data } = await supabase.storage
    .from('signatures')
    .download(path);

  // Decrypt after receiving from Supabase
  return await FERPAEncryption.decryptFile(data);
}
```

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ Additional security layer
- ✅ Application controls encryption keys
- ❌ Increased complexity
- ❌ Performance overhead (double encryption/decryption)
- ❌ Must manage encryption keys in application
- ❌ Breaks existing PDFs (requires migration)

**Recommendation:** Defer unless specifically required by audit.

## Code Comments

### Storage Upload Functions

Add these comments to your storage upload/download functions:

```typescript
/**
 * Upload signed consent form to storage
 *
 * FERPA Compliance Notes:
 * - Storage Bucket: signatures/signed
 * - Encryption: AES-256 at rest (Supabase infrastructure)
 * - Contains PII: Student/parent names, emails, signatures
 * - Retention: 7 years per FERPA
 * - Access Control: RLS policies enforced
 * - Audit: All uploads logged to activity_logs table
 * - DPA: Covered under Supabase Data Processing Agreement
 *
 * @see docs/security/storage-encryption.md

 */
export async function uploadSignedAgreement(
  competitorId: string,
  pdfBuffer: Buffer
): Promise<string> {
  // ... implementation
}
```

3. **Retention:** As per Supabase plan (typically 7 days free, longer for paid)

### Audit Trail

Storage-related actions logged in `activity_logs` table:
- `agreement_signed` - When signed PDF uploaded
- `consent_revoked` - When agreement PDF deleted
- `data_disclosed_zoho` - When data sent to Zoho (creates PDF in storage)

---

## Backup & Recovery

**Supabase Automatic Backups:**
- Daily automated backups (for paid plans)
- Point-in-time recovery available
- Backups are encrypted at rest

**Manual Backups:**
```bash
# Download all files from a bucket (for local backup)
supabase storage download signatures/ ./backups/signatures/
```

---

## Incident Response

**In case of suspected storage breach:**

1. **Immediate:**
   - Rotate Supabase service role keys
   - Review RLS policies
   - Check Supabase logs for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation:**
   - Review `activity_logs` for suspicious patterns
   - Check storage access logs in Supabase dashboard
   - Identify affected files/competitors

3. **Notification:**
   - Follow FERPA breach notification requirements
   - Notify affected students/parents within 45 days
   - Document incident per institutional policy
