# Messaging System FERPA Compliance Refactor Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation strategy for refactoring the messaging system to achieve FERPA compliance while minimizing disruption to existing functionality.

## Current State Assessment

**Current Architecture Issues:**
- **Destructive Archiving**: Messages are permanently deleted from database during archiving (FERPA violation)
- **Shared State Model**: No per-user message state isolation
- **Mixed Archive Approaches**: Some conversations use `conversation_members.archived_at`, others use `archived_messages` table
- **Complex Query Logic**: Current queries mix shared and private data without clear separation

**FERPA Compliance Requirements:**
- Student data must be properly isolated between users
- No user should see another's private flags, archives, or state
- Messages should be preserved (no hard deletes)
- Clear audit trail of all actions
- Data retention policies must be followed

## Phase 1: Database Schema Migration (Week 1-2)

### Step 1.1: Create new message_user_state table
- [x] Create `message_user_state` table with proper schema, indexes, and RLS policies
- [x] Define table structure: `(id, user_id, message_id, flagged, archived_at, created_at)`
- [x] Create performance indexes: `idx_message_user_state_user_message`, `idx_message_user_state_user_flagged`, `idx_message_user_state_user_archived`
- [x] Implement RLS policies ensuring users only see their own state


### Step 1.3: Update archive functions
- [x] Replace destructive archive functions with soft-archive approach
- [x] Implement `archive_message_user()` function that updates `message_user_state.archived_at = NOW()`
- [x] Implement `unarchive_message_user()` function that sets `message_user_state.archived_at = NULL`
- [x] Update conversation archiving to use per-user state model
- [x] Remove all destructive delete operations from archive functions

## Phase 2: API Route Refactoring (Week 3-4)

### Step 2.1: Update conversation queries
- [x] Modify `/api/messaging/conversations` to use new state model
- [x] Add proper LEFT JOIN with `message_user_state` filtered by current user
- [x] Ensure RLS policies prevent cross-user state access
- [x] Test conversation listing with archived/non-archived filtering

### Step 2.2: Update message flagging
- [x] Modify `/api/messaging/messages/[id]/flag` to use `message_user_state`
- [x] Implement proper UPSERT logic for flag toggles (INSERT or UPDATE)
- [x] Add validation to ensure users can only flag messages they have access to
- [x] Test flag toggle functionality per user

### Step 2.3: Update archive endpoints
- [x] Update `/api/messaging/conversations/[id]/archive` to use `message_user_state`
- [x] Update `/api/messaging/messages/[id]/archive` to use `message_user_state`
- [x] Remove all destructive delete operations from archive endpoints
- [x] Test archive/unarchive functionality for both conversations and individual messages

### Step 2.4: Update read receipts
- [x] Verify `message_read_receipts` functionality remains unchanged (already FERPA compliant)
- [x] Ensure read receipt queries properly filter by user
- [x] Test read receipt marking across different users

## Phase 3: Frontend Component Updates (Week 5-6)

### Step 3.1: Update query logic in useCoachMessagingData
- [x] Replace current query patterns with new LEFT JOIN approach
- [x] Implement proper state filtering per user in data fetching hooks
- [x] Update conversation loading to respect per-user archive state
- [x] Test data loading with mixed archived/non-archived content

### Step 3.2: Update archive/flagging UI components
- [x] Update archive UI to hide messages for current user only (not delete)
- [x] Update flag UI to show private flags per user
- [x] Ensure no changes to message content or thread structure
- [x] Test UI behavior with multiple users having different states

### Step 3.3: Update admin messaging components
- [x] Verify admin messages use same isolation model (uses same API routes)
- [x] Ensure admin flags/archives are private to admin user (FERPA-compliant backend)
- [x] Confirm announcements remain read-only for recipients (existing functionality preserved)
- [x] Test admin messaging workflows

**Note:** Found orphaned `admin-legacy.tsx` file that should be removed in cleanup phase (not referenced anywhere)

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 7-8)

### Step 4.1: Unit Tests
- [x] Test per-user state isolation (users cannot see each other's flags/archives)
- [ ] Test archive/unarchive functionality preserves message data
- [x] Test flag privacy between users in same conversation
- [ ] Test conversation vs message-level archiving behavior

### Step 4.2: Integration Tests
- [x] Test full conversation flows with multiple users
- [x] Test admin messaging capabilities
- [x] Test announcement functionality
- [x] Test FERPA compliance scenarios (data isolation verification)

### Step 4.3: Performance Testing
- [x] Validate query performance with new indexes
- [ ] Test with large conversation histories (1000+ messages)
- [x] Ensure no performance regressions in conversation loading
- [x] Monitor database load during peak usage

## Phase 5: Comprehensive Cleanup & Optimization (Week 9-10)

### Step 5.1: Repository-wide messaging component audit
- [x] Search entire codebase for messaging-related files, routes, and components
- [x] Identify all API routes under `app/dashboard/messages/*` and `app/dashboard/messages-v2` and subdirectories
- [x] Catalog all React components in `/components/coach-messaging/*` and `/components/messaging/*`
- [x] Find all messaging-related utilities in `/lib/coach-messaging/*` and `/lib/messaging/*`
- [x] Document all messaging references in other parts of the application

### Step 5.2: Database function and trigger audit
- [x] Query all database functions containing 'message', 'conversation', 'archive' in their names
- [x] Identify all database triggers related to messaging tables
- [x] Catalog all RPC functions used by messaging API routes
- [x] Check for any orphaned functions/triggers not referenced in current code
- [x] Document dependencies between functions and API routes

### Step 5.3: Legacy code identification and removal
- [x] Identify routes using destructive archiving approaches (DELETE operations on messages)
- [x] Remove legacy archive endpoints that delete data from database
- [x] Remove unused conversation management routes not referenced in current UI
- [x] Remove obsolete React components not used in current messaging workspace
- [x] Clean up unused utility functions in messaging libraries

### Step 5.4: Database cleanup execution
- [x] Remove `archive_conversation_v2()` and related destructive functions
- [x] Remove `archive_message()` and other hard-delete functions
- [x] Remove functions that perform hard deletes of messages/conversations
- [x] Remove legacy query functions that don't use new state model
- [x] Drop triggers that cascade delete messages or violate state isolation
- [x] Clean up orphaned trigger definitions and dependencies

### Step 5.5: Code repository cleanup
- [x] Remove unused API route files identified in audit
- [x] Remove obsolete React components identified in audit
- [x] Clean up unused utility functions and helper files
- [x] Remove dead imports and references to deleted components
- [x] Update import statements across the codebase

### Step 5.6: Documentation and configuration cleanup
- [x] Update API documentation to reflect removed endpoints
- [x] Remove references to deleted functions from database documentation
- [x] Clean up migration files that reference removed components
- [x] Update configuration files if any messaging settings changed
- [x] Remove any unused environment variables related to messaging

### Step 5.7: Database optimization and maintenance
- [x] Analyze query performance with new schema and add additional indexes if needed
- [x] Update database statistics for query optimizer accuracy
- [x] Consider partitioning large message tables if volume grows significantly
- [x] Implement database maintenance routines for archive cleanup
- [x] Set up monitoring for new query patterns and performance

## Risk Mitigation

### Performance Monitoring
- [x] Monitor query performance during rollout
- [x] Set up alerts for slow queries
- [x] Track database load and response times
- [x] Implement performance regression detection

## Success Metrics
